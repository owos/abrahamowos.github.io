I am a Machine Learning research engineer. My journey in machine learning has been a deep dive into the multifaceted realms of low-resource NLP, multilinguality, and speech technologies. One of my most profound research pursuits revolves around the recognition and enhancement of African accents in speech technology, addressing the gaps and nuances often overlooked in mainstream studies.

My contributions to the AI research community are extensive and varied. With a flair for integrating cutting-edge techniques, I've explored the linguistic intricacies of African accents for zero-shot ASR adaptation, developed recommender systems that dynamically gauge model compatibility with language samples, and established baseline models for over 360 languages across a plethora of tasks. My works have found acclaim in revered platforms such as EMNLP and ICLR.

Beyond the technical realms of my research, I harbor a deep passion for building and nurturing open science communities. I firmly believe in democratizing access to knowledge, fostering collaborative ecosystems, and championing the ethos of shared discovery. It's this fusion of innovative research and community-driven passion that defines my journey in AI.
