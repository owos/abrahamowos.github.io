I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University where I have been privilaged be advised by the awesome Prof. [Sachin Kumar](https://sites.google.com/view/sachinkumar). Before that, I was a researcher at [IntronHealth](https://www.intron.io/) during which I work on creating language and speech technologies to African  accents and languages (including MENA). 

I am also an independent researcher at [Masakhane](https://www.masakhane.io/), an open science community where Africans do AI research for Africa. I am primarily interested in investigating novel ways to develop **robust** **multilingual** models in **resource-constrained** settings, particularly  using **efficient** ML techniques. 

Beyond the technical aspect of research, I worked on creating national AI policies within Nigerian and Africa, I enjoy mentoring new folks that are interested in getting into AI research and I love building and nurturing open science ML communities. You'll find me around [Sisonke Biotik](https://www.sisonkebiotik.africa/), [ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org/), Cohere4AI and a few others. I firmly believe in democratizing access to knowledge, fostering collaborative ecosystems, and championing the ethos of shared discovery. 

If I'm not doing AI research, you can find me playing Pool, Lawn and Table Tennis (I suck at both though), reading books and listening podcasts.
