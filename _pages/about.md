I am an independent research at [Masakhane](https://www.masakhane.io/), an open science community where African do AI research for Africa. I am primarily interested in investigating novel ways to develop **robust** **multilingual** models in **resource-constrained** settings using **efficient** ML techniques. 

Also, I am a research engineer at [IntronHealth](https://www.intron.io/). At IntronHealth I work on creating  speech technologies to African (including MENA) accents and languages. These includes Automatic Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech systems. As would align with my research interest, I also work robustness, and examining the tradeoff between multilinguality and performance. Take a look at my CV for more details about my work with IntronHealth.

Beyond the technical aspect of research, I love building and nurturing open science ML communities. You'll find me around [Sisonke Biotik](https://www.sisonkebiotik.africa/), [ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org/), Cohere4AI and a few others. I firmly believe in democratizing access to knowledge, fostering collaborative ecosystems, and championing the ethos of shared discovery.
